## What is this repository used for?

This documentation repo is used to collate all information regarding NASA Protocol Research. Every
project needs good documentation and Hardhats mission is to ensure there are good documentation
paradigms in place which would set the company up for success in the future.

Each team has their own separate repository and these are supposed to be used for anything related
to the team projects. Additionally, if you have documentation elsewhere, we recommend that you begin
a small migration process to this repository within a .md format.
