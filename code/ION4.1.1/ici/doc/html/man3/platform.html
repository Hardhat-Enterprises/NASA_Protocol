<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><em>platform</em> is a library of functions that simplify the porting of
software written in C.  It provides an API that enables application 
code to access the resources of an abstract POSIX-compliant
``least common denominator'' operating system -- typically a large
subset of the resources of the actual underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Most of the functionality provided by the platform library is
aimed at making communication code portable: common functions for
shared memory, semaphores, and IP sockets are provided.  
The implementation of the abstract O/S API varies according
to the actual operating system on which the application runs, but
the API's behavior is always the same; applications that invoke
the platform library functions rather than native O/S system
calls may forego some O/S-specific capability, but they gain portability 
at little if any cost in performance.</p>
<p>Differences in word size among platforms are implemented by values
of the <em>SPACE_ORDER</em> macro.  ``Space order'' is the base 2 log of the
number of octets in a word: for 32-bit machines the space order is
2 (2^2 = 4 octets per word), for 64-bit machines it is 3 (2^3 = 8
octets per word).</p>
<p>A consistent platform-independent representation of large integers is
useful for some applications.  For this purpose, <em>platform</em> defines
new types <strong>vast</strong> and <strong>uvast</strong> (unsigned vast) which are consistently
defined to be 64-bit integers regardless of the platform's native word
size.</p>
<p>The platform.h header file #includes many of the most frequently
needed header files: sys/types.h, errno.h, string.h, stdio.h,
sys/socket.h, signal.h, dirent.h, netinet/in.h, unistd.h,
stdlib.h, sys/time.h, sys/resource.h, malloc.h, sys/param.h,
netdb.h, sys/uni.h, and fcntl.h.  Beyond this, <em>platform</em> attempts 
to enhance compatibility by providing standard macros,
type definitions, external references, or function implementations 
that are missing from a few supported O/S's but supported
by all others.  Finally, entirely new, generic functions are provided 
to establish a common body of functionality that subsumes
significantly different O/S-specific capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="platform_compatibility_patches">PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY PATCHES</a></h2>
<p>The platform library ``patches'' the APIs of supported O/S's to
guarantee that all of the following items may be utilized by application 
software:</p>
<pre>
    The strchr(), strrchr(), strcasecmp(), and strncasecmp() functions.</pre>
<pre>
    The unlink(), getpid(), and gettimeofday() functions.</pre>
<pre>
    The select() function.</pre>
<pre>
    The FD_BITMAP macro (used by select()).</pre>
<pre>
    The MAXHOSTNAMELEN macro.</pre>
<pre>
    The NULL macro.</pre>
<pre>
    The timer_t type definition.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="platform_generic_macros_and_functions">PLATFORM GENERIC MACROS AND FUNCTIONS</a></h2>
<p>The generic macros and functions in this section may be used in
place of comparable O/S-specific functions, to enhance the portability 
of code.  (The implementations of these macros and functions are 
no-ops in environments in which they are inapplicable,
so they're always safe to call.)</p>

into <em>buffer</em> and writes a NULL character at the end of the string.  The
newline character itself is omitted from the NULL-terminated text line in
<em>buffer</em>; if the newline is immediately preceded by a carriage return
character (i.e., the line is from a DOS text file), then the carriage return
character is likewise omitted from the NULL-terminated text line in
<em>buffer</em>.  End of file is interpreted as an implicit newline, terminating
the line.  If the number of characters preceding the newline is greater
than or equal to <em>buflen</em>, only the first (<em>buflen</em> - 1) characters of
the line are written into <em>buffer</em>.  On error the function sets <em>*lineLen</em>
to -1 and returns NULL.  On reading end-of-file, the function sets <em>*lineLen</em>
to zero and returns NULL.  Otherwise the function sets <em>*lineLen</em> to the

<dd>
<p>Uses <code>memalign()</code> to allocate a block of system memory of length <em>size</em>,

This function provides common file creation functionality across VxWorks and
Unix platforms, invoking <code>creat()</code> under VxWorks and <code>open()</code> elsewhere.  For

the string.  <em>socketSpec</em> is expected to be of the form
``{ @ | hostname }[:&lt;portnbr&gt;]'', where @ signifies ``the host name of the

<p>Makes I/O on the socket identified by <em>fd</em> non-blocking; returns -1 on
failure.  An attempt to read on a non-blocking socket when no data are pending,

<h2><a name="exception_reporting">EXCEPTION REPORTING</a></h2>
<p>The functions in this section offer platform-independent capabilities
for reporting on processing exceptions.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanism for ICI's exception reporting is a pair of
functions that record error messages in a privately managed pool of
static memory.  These functions -- <a href="#item_posterrmsg"><code>postErrmsg()</code></a> and <a href="#item_postsyserrmsg"><code>postSysErrmsg()</code></a> --
are designed to return very rapidly with no possibility of failing,
themselves.  Nonetheless they are not safe to call from an interrupt
service routing (ISR).  Although each merely copies its text to the
next available location in the error message memory pool, that pool
is protected by a mutex; multiple processes might be queued up to
take that mutex, so the total time to execute the function is
non-deterministic.</p>
<p>Built on top of <a href="#item_posterrmsg"><code>postErrmsg()</code></a> and <a href="#item_postsyserrmsg"><code>postSysErrmsg()</code></a> are the <a href="#item_puterrmsg"><code>putErrmsg()</code></a>
and <a href="#item_putsyserrmsg"><code>putSysErrmsg()</code></a> functions, which may take longer to return.  Each
one simply calls the corresponding ``post'' function but then calls the
<a href="#item_writeerrmsgmemos"><code>writeErrmsgMemos()</code></a> function, which calls <a href="#item_writememo"><code>writeMemo()</code></a> to print (or
otherwise deliver) each message currently posted to the pool and
then destroys all of those posted messages, emptying the pool.</p>
<p>Recommended general policy on using the ICI exception reporting functions
(which the functions in the ION distribution libraries are supposed to
adhere to) is as follows:</p>
<pre>
        In the implementation of any ION library function or any ION
        task's top-level driver function, any condition that prevents
        the function from continuing execution toward producing the
        effect it is designed to produce is considered an &quot;error&quot;.</pre>
<pre>
        Detection of an error should result in the printing of an
        error message and, normally, the immediate return of whatever
        return value is used to indicate the failure of the function
        in which the error was detected.  By convention this value
        is usually -1, but both zero and NULL are appropriate
        failure indications under some circumstances such as object
        creation.</pre>
<pre>
        The CHKERR, CHKZERO, CHKNULL, and CHKVOID macros are used to
        implement this behavior in a standard and lexically terse
        manner.  Use of these macros offers an additional feature:
        for debugging purposes, they can easily be configured to
        call sm_Abort() to terminate immediately with a core dump
        instead of returning a error indication.  This option is
        enabled by setting the compiler parameter CORE_FILE_NEEDED
        to 1 at compilation time.</pre>
<pre>
        In the absence of either any error, the function returns a
        value that indicates nominal completion.  By convention this
        value is usually zero, but under some circumstances other
        values (such as pointers or addresses) are appropriate
        indications of nominal completion.  Any additional information
        produced by the function, such as an indication of &quot;success&quot;,
        is usually returned as the value of a reference argument.
        [Note, though, that database management functions and the
        SDR hash table management functions deviate from this rule:
        most return 0 to indicate nominal completion but functional
        failure (e.g., duplicate key or object not found) and return
        1 to indicate functional success.]</pre>
<pre>
        So when returning a value that indicates nominal completion
        of the function -- even if the result might be interpreted
        as a failure at a higher level (e.g., an object identified
        by a given string is not found, through no failure of the
        search function) -- do NOT invoke putErrmsg().</pre>
<pre>
        Use putErrmsg() and putSysErrmsg() only when functions are
        unable to proceed to nominal completion.  Use writeMemo()
        or writeMemoNote() if you just want to log a message.</pre>
<pre>
        Whenever returning a value that indicates an error:</pre>
<pre>
                If the failure is due to the failure of a system call
                or some other non-ION function, assume that errno
                has already been set by the function at the lowest
                layer of the call stack; use putSysErrmsg (or
                postSysErrmsg if in a hurry) to describe the nature
                of the activity that failed.  The text of the error
                message should normally start with a capital letter
                and should NOT end with a period.</pre>
<pre>
                Otherwise -- i.e., the failure is due to a condition
                that was detected within ION -- use putErrmsg (or
                postErrmg if pressed for time) to describe the nature
                of the failure condition.  This will aid in tracing
                the failure through the function stack in which the
                failure was detected.  The text of the error message
                should normally start with a capital letter and should
                end with a period.</pre>
<pre>
        When a failure in a called function is reported to &quot;driver&quot;
        code in an application program, before continuing or exiting
        use writeErrmsgMemos() to empty the message pool and print a
        simple stack trace identifying the failure.</pre>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_system_error_msg">char *system_error_msg( )</a></strong>

the highest-priority task waiting for it receives it when

<dd>
<p>This function implements the concept that for each task there can
always be one dedicated semaphore, which the task can always use for its
own purposes, whose key value may be known a priori because the key of the
semaphore is based on the task's ID.  The design of the function
rests on the assumption that each task's ID, whether a VxWorks task ID
or a Unix process ID, maps to a number that is out of the range of all
possible key values that are arbitrarily produced by sm_GetUniqueKey().
For VxWorks, we assume this to be true because task ID is a pointer to
task state in memory which we assume not to exceed 2GB; the unique key
counter starts at 2GB.  For Unix, we assume this to be true because
process ID is an index into a process table whose size is less than 64K;
unique keys are formed by shifting process ID left 16 bits and adding
the value of an incremented counter which is always greater than zero.</p>

<em>size</em> may be zero and the value of <em>*shmPtr</em> is ignored.
Otherwise the size of the shared memory segment must be provided

<dd>
<p>Parses <em>script</em> into a command name and up to 10 arguments, then passes the
command name and arguments to <a href="#item_sm_taskspawn"><code>sm_TaskSpawn()</code></a> for execution.
The <a href="#item_sm_taskspawn"><code>sm_TaskSpawn()</code></a> function is invoked with priority and stack size both
set to zero, causing default values (possibly from an application-defined
private symbol table) to be used.  Tokens in 
<em>script</em> are normally whitespace-delimited, but a token that is enclosed in
single-quote characters (') may contain embedded whitespace and may contain
escaped single-quote characters (``\''').  On any parsing
failure returns -1; otherwise returns the value returned by sm_TaskSpawn().</p>
