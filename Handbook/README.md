# The NASA Protocol Exploits Project Handbook

This is where we'll share everything project related, our project structure, and our processes.

It's the central guide to provide a better understanding of what we believe in and how we run the project. As part of our value of being transparent, the handbook is open to the world and we welcome feedback.
